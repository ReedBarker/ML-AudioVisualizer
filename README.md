During my recent Game Development internship at Human Mode, I developed games/worlds for their metaverse using Unity and LUA. My main project used a large multidimensional array to extract frequencies from songs and trigger in-game events. For example, the user would select beat frequency on the histogram. If the selection reached a specific amplitude, a color would be changed. Currently, there are many groups of events along the timeline and many events on the histogram within that group. That way, fireworks can happen at different points in the song, or colors change whenever a non-beat part of the song plays, and so on.
